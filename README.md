### I'm a software engineer based out of New York with a non-traditional background in health and fitness. I working on developing my skills on a daily basis, focusing primarily on Javascript, Express, ReactJS, and MongoDB. I recently created a blog where I track my progress as a developer.

### - 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal app based around self development and psychology.

### - 🌱 I’m currently working on developing my skills on the NEXTJS framework.

### - 🤔 Something else I am working on is a typescript opensource project.

### - 💬 Ask me about anything health and fitness related


### Feel free to check out my portfolio or blog to see how I solved certain problems in my developing career as a software engineer.
